# Real-Time Sign Language Detection using Transformer + MediaPipe

This project implements a real-time sign language gesture classification system using **MediaPipe Holistic** for keypoint extraction and a custom-built **Transformer model (PyTorch)** for sequence classification. It runs directly on your webcam and provides live predictions.

---

## Overview

- **Keypoint Extraction**: Uses [MediaPipe Holistic](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/holistic.html) to extract 3D landmarks of face, pose, and both hands.
- **Sequence Modeling**: A Transformer model learns temporal dynamics over a sequence of 30 frames to classify the gesture.
- **Live Prediction**: Real-time classification with probability bars, sentence construction, and action stability using a debouncing technique.

## How It Works

1. **Capture Webcam Feed**
2. **Extract 3D Landmarks** using MediaPipe Holistic
3. **Buffer 30-Frame Sequences**
4. **Infer with Transformer Model**
5. **Visualize Gesture Probabilities & Sentence**

## Transformer Model Architecture

The model is based on the **Transformer Encoder** architecture adapted for gesture classification.

### Architecture Details:

- **Input**: Shape `(Batch, 30, 1662)` → 30 frames of keypoints (each frame has 1662 features)
- **Positional Encoding**: Injects temporal information
- **Transformer Encoder Layers** (×4):
  - Multi-Head Self Attention
  - Layer Normalization
  - Feed-Forward Network
  - Residual Connections
- **Global Average Pooling**: Compresses time dimension
- **Fully Connected Layer** → Softmax

### Theory

- **Self-Attention** captures the relationship between keypoints across frames.
- **Multi-head Attention** allows learning from multiple temporal contexts.
- **Positional Encoding** ensures the model knows the order of frames.
- **Transformer Encoders** handle long-range dependencies efficiently, making them ideal for tracking dynamic hand gestures and body motions.

## Recognized Gestures

The current model is trained on the following signs:

 Label      | Description                        
------------|------------------------------------
 `hello`    | Hand from side of your forehead to outwards                
 `thanks`   | Hand from chin to outwards           
 `yes`      | Fist nodding motion                
 `no`       | Index and middle fingers meeting your thumb                  
 `i_love_you` | Classic one-handed "I ❤️ U" sign   
 `please`   | Hand circling on chest             
 `stop`     | Open palm gesture                  
 `help`     | Thumb out of one hand placing on others open palm
 `goodbye`  | Wave with open hand                
 `okay`     | Thumb and index forming an "O" and rest open wide
 `sorry`    | Fist circling on chest

## Training Pipeline

1. **Collect Data**: Capture sequences using MediaPipe and store `.npy` files.
2. **Preprocess**: Shape data into `(N, 30, 1662)` arrays.
3. **Train Model**
4. **Save Model**: Save and load `.pt` weights for inference.
